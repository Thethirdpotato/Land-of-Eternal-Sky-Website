          Mongolian culture has deep roots in Buddhism, shamanism, and animism, and the main religion in Mongolia is Buddhism, with 90% of the population. Mongolian Buddhism is an essential part of the country's religious practices, with monasteries and temples scattered throughout the country. The most famous of these is the Gandantegchinlen Monastery in the capital city.

          Shamanism holds a central place in Mongolia's cultural heritage, serving as a conduit between the physical and spiritual realms. Shamans, known as "buu," engage in rituals that involve chanting, drumming, and trance-like states to communicate with spirits and seek guidance for the community. The sacred landscape of Mongolia, with its mountains, rivers, and vast steppes, is considered imbued with spiritual significance. Despite the influence of Buddhism and other religions over the centuries, shamanistic practices persist, illustrating the resilience of this ancient belief system in the fabric of Mongolian culture.

            The Mongolian lifestyle revolves around nomadic traditions, emphasizing a profound connection to the expansive steppes. Nomadic herding is central to daily life, with families relying on the land and livestock for survival. Portable dwellings, known as "gers" or "yurts," reflect mobility and follow seasonal grazing patterns. Cultural practices like throat singing, traditional dances, and festivals such as Naadam celebrate Mongolia's rich nomadic heritage. Despite modern influences, the essence of Mongolian lifestyle lies in harmony with nature, resilience, and a strong sense of community.
